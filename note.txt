1. We have ON_LSTM.py
2. do we have decoder?
3. we need to build our own encoder and decoder
4. now we start to 
    build our model

- No attention layers in ON_LSTM!
- encoder_output: encoder states, encoder hidden, attention mask
- However, in the original ON_LSTM model, model.decoder is just used in calculating loss

- Working on tree.py ...
- Working on train() in main.py ...

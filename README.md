# A Sentence to Sentence Baseline Model

This model is intended to implement a baseline using encoder from [ON_LSTM](https://github.com/yikangshen/Ordered-Neurons) and decoder from [non-monotonic generation](https://github.com/wellecks/nonmonotonic_text).

We choose the penn dataset which is the same as in [ON_LSTM](https://github.com/yikangshen/Ordered-Neurons).

To fit the dataset, we had to do a few modification with the encoder and decoder models.
